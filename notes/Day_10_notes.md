# Day 10: Revising AI Concepts, Python Practice & Git Workflow
#Day10 of #100DaysOfLearningAI

Today’s focus: **reviewing key AI concepts**, **practicing Python basics**, and **improving Git workflow** for better organization.

---

## 1. Revising AI Concepts

### Key Areas Reviewed:
1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
   - Machines simulating human intelligence.
   - Examples: chatbots, recommendation systems, self-driving cars.

2. **Machine Learning (ML)**
   - A subset of AI that **learns patterns from data**.
   - Examples: email spam filters, loan approval models.

3. **Deep Learning (DL)**
   - A subset of ML using **neural networks** for complex tasks.
   - Examples: image recognition, speech recognition.

4. **Generative AI**
   - AI models that **create new content**: text, images, audio.
   - Examples: ChatGPT, DALL·E, GitHub Copilot.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Revising helps connect concepts to practical exercises.
- Understanding hierarchy: AI > ML > DL > Generative AI.

## 2. Practicing Python Basics

### Focus Areas:
- Variables, Strings, Numbers
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Functions (from Day 8 & 7 projects)

**Mini-Projects Reviewed Today:**
1. **Tip Calculator**
   - Practice math operations and user input.
2. **Password Generator**
   - Practice loops and lists.
3. **Caesar Cipher**
   - Practice functions and modular arithmetic.

**Why this matters:**  
Consistent Python practice builds a strong foundation for AI/ML coding tasks.

## 3. Improving Git Workflow

### Git Actions Performed:
- Committing small changes with meaningful messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day10: Revised AI concepts and Python practice"
Creating branches for experiments:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b day10-practice
Merging changes into main branch after review.

Pushing updates to remote GitHub repo:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Benefits of daily Git practice:

Keeps code organized

Shows progress to recruiters

Prepares for professional workflow
