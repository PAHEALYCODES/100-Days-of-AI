#Day9 of #100DaysOfLearningAI

Today’s focus: **enhancing Git skills** and organizing my AI learning notes for AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01).

## 1. Git Practice: Branching, Merging, and Committing

### Key Concepts

1. **Branching**
   - Branches allow you to **work on different features or projects independently**.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch new-feature
     git checkout new-feature
     ```
   - This creates a separate workspace for changes without affecting the main branch.

2. **Committing**
   - Save snapshots of your project with messages explaining what changed.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add Day 9 Git practice notes"
     ```

3. **Merging**
   - Combine changes from one branch into another (e.g., feature branch → main branch).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge new-feature
     ```

4. **Pushing to Remote**
   - Upload your changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

**Why this is important:**  
- Makes collaboration easier.
- Keeps track of progress and learning.
- Allows experimentation without breaking main code.

## 2. Organizing AWS AI Notes

Today, I **structured my notes** for the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) exam**.  

### Key Actions:
- Categorized concepts under **AI, ML, DL, Generative AI**.
- Linked **practical exercises** and real-world examples.
- Added placeholders for **diagrams and code snippets**.
